# Bug Bounty Beginner's Roadmap

Hi! I'm **Abhiram SS**. I am currently graduating Bachelors's in Computer Application and **Certified Penetration Tester**. I am creating this repository for everyone to contribute as to guide the young and enthusiastic minds for starting their career in bug bounties. More content will be added regularly. Keep following. So let's get started!

# Introduction
- **What is Bug Bounty?**
	 -   A bug bounty program gives ethical hackers permission to test if an organization's applications contain certain types of vulnerabilities. The details of bug bounty programs can vary from one organization to another.



- **What is the Reward?**
	 - There are all types of rewards based on the severity of  the issue and the cost to fix. They may range from real money (most prevalent) to premium subscriptions (Prime/Netflix), discount coupons (for e commerce of shopping sites), gift vouchers, swags (apparels, badges, customized stationery, etc.). *Money may range from 50$ to 50,000$ and even more.*

## Mindset
If you are beginning bug bounty hunting, you will need to know that it will take time to learn the bug hunting skills. You need to have the patience and determination to continue hunting even though you might not see successful results quickly. The bug bounty field is crowded and competitive, hence you will require hardwork, dedication, lateral thinking to persist on. Hunting is about learning and acting noob all the time. Everyone starts from somewhere.
